Walmart was founded in 1962 by SAM WALTON in the United State of America. The main purpose of Walmart was to help people save money, with time Walmart expanded to many countries.Walmart offers different categories of products,it also provides online shopping home delivery,curbside pickup.
Excel Query was use in this data wrangling/cleaning;blanks were checked, dublicates, data type. I proeeded to create more sheets in the query editor, renaming them as follows;   ORDER,CUSTOMERS,PRODUCTS,LOCATION,AND CALENDER. Order being the largest as it contains almost all information,merges were made which our Query Dependency came out lookng good and well connected to each other.I noticed in the loaded data there was no ship date and order date, that lead me to the dictionary of the data which had link.The hidden order date ad ship date were downloaded and that led us to creatiobg calender.Questions were derieved as i was working on the data
